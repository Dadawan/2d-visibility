# 2D Visibility Algorithm

The 2d visibility agolrithm described in [this article](http://www.redblobgames.com/articles/visibility/), ported by hand to ES2016 JavaScript and refactored significantly to suit my taste better. So it's not quite a 1-to-1 port and I went for a more functional approach.

I highly suggest reading the article. It's very well explained with some really awesome interactive examples and provides the code in multiple languages. The original code was wrriten in Haxe, which can compile into JavaScript but I found the generated JS to be rather difficult to read and comes with an (unncessary) doubly linked list implementation.
